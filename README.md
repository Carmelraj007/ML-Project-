# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning & Technical Indicators

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stock market trends and predicting stock prices using machine learning models and technical indicators. The objective is to build a predictive model that can assist traders and investors in making data-driven decisions.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing from financial sources.
- Feature engineering using technical indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights into stock market trends.
- Implementation of Machine Learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, etc.
- Model evaluation and performance comparison.
- Data visualization for better insights.
